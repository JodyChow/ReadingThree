				"TODAY, OF COURSE, THE <u id="cloud">CLOUD</u>
				HAS BECOME SO <u>NATURALIZED</u> IN EVERYDAY LIFE THAT WE
				TEND TO
				LOOK RIGHT
				THROUGH
				IT, SEEING IT UNCRITICALLY, IF WE SEE IT AT ALL."
			</h1>

			<p id="para">We see the cloud as just an open space where one stores and shares information, but what is
				truly
				behind it if you think about it? We do not even realize how ingrained and naturalized the idea of the
				cloud
				is in our
				everyday. This open environment is easily accessible through objects such as our mobile devices and is
				essentially powered by our own data as well as our data trails. Without them . . . would it even run at
				all?
				The cloud, as an idea, has become more and more of an influence on the way in which society has come to
				organize and understand itself. It allows its users to self-regulate themselves with a sense of
				“freedom” in
				a controlled society.</p>
